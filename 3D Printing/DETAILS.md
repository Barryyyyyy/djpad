# What are these parts?

The parts found here are 3D printable replicas of arcade accurate frames I designed to hold the sensors as well as secure the polycarbonate panels in place. 

The "Split" parts are split in either corners or halves, I haven't completed all of them yet, and you're free to split them yourself as well if needed. The parts outside that folder aren't split and are a single piece for printing on larger printers. My Creality CR-10S can print the entire C frame in one piece but can't print the LR frames without them being split in half, for example.
