# What are these?

These are files for the custom printed circuit board I designed to help make connecting the velostat and stuff easier! The PCB houses the Arduino Nano and Wemos D1 Mini, as well as the JST XH connectors for hooking up the sensors, power, lights, IO, and expansion stuff. 

# What is each file for?

The EasyEDA json file is for importing the project to EasyEDA. I designed this on the web-based version of the software, but I think it'll work with the desktop version too.

The Gerber zip is for uploading straight to a manufacturer to be ordered. I use JLCPCB since their services are super affordable, but I've also heard great things about OSH Park (they have some real neat purple PCBs as well).
