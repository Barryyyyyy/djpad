# Features
- Wifi hotspot for web based sensitivity adjustment (ccode by [skogaby](https://github.com/skogaby), modified CSS by me)
- Lighting and IO support via custom PCB; Arduino Nano can output to any kind of input device, such as a PIUIO (or [PIUIO clone](https://github.com/racerxdl/piuio_clone/tree/simple/), keyboard, or controller via the digital pins (separate controller board required!)
- Doubles/2nd player pad support via custom PCB
